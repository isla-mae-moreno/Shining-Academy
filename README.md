# Shining-Academy
Shining Academy is my first ever solo Visual Novel project.
## Synopsis
It's a new school year, and you plan to make it the best one yet. However, in a turn of fate, you end up meeting a girl who you fall in love with...

The game follows your journey of getting to know this girl, and ultimately confessing your love.
## When will it be released?
Right now, it's in very early development. I don't have a deadline at this stage.
